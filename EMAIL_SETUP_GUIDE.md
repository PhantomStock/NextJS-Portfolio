# Email Integration Setup Guide

This guide explains the email setup for Wilson's portfolio contact form.

## 🚀 Current Setup

### Email Delivery
All contact form submissions are delivered to: **`wilcampos2003@gmail.com`**

This is the only verified email address in the Resend account and the only address that can receive emails through the contact form.

### Why This Setup?

**Resend Free Tier Limitations:**
- ✅ Can only send emails to verified email addresses
- ✅ `wilcampos2003@gmail.com` is verified and working
